# Currency Exchange Android App

This is an Android app that allows users to exchange currencies, check their balances, and view available accounts. It utilizes Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and various Android libraries for a smooth and efficient user experience.

## Features

- **Currency Conversion**: Convert between different currencies using real-time exchange rates.
- **Transaction History**: View available accounts and balances after each transaction.
- **User-Friendly UI**: Simple and interactive user interface built using Jetpack Compose.
- **Error Handling**: Show appropriate error messages when funds are insufficient.

## Tech Stack

- **Kotlin**: The main programming language.
- **Ð§XML**: For building the UI.
- **Dagger 2**: For dependency injection.
- **Room**: For local data storage.
- **Retrofit**: For making network requests.
- **RxJava**: For reactive programming.
- **ViewBinding**: For binding UI elements.
- **ViewPager2**: For showing currency options in a swipeable view.

## Architecture

The app follows the **MVI (Model-View-Intent)** and **MVVM** architectural patterns for clean separation of concerns.

- **Model**: Holds the app data and business logic (view models, repositories, etc.).
- **View**: UI components built using Jetpack Compose, handling user interactions.
- **Intent**: User actions that are interpreted and processed by the app.
